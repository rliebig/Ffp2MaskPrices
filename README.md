# FFP 2 Mask Prices

With medical masks becoming mandatory in public transit in Germany, I was curious how market dynamics would actually play out.

This is a crude, smol tool written in rust to monitor Amazon prices for FFP" masks over the coming weeks and months.

It utilizes tui-rs for graphics, reqwest for HTTP and select-rs for parsing.

Still a work in progress, will probably update this in the near future.
